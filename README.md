# Mass-Spectrometry-Data-Processing-and-Annotation-Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a collection of Python scripts for processing and analyzing mass spectrometry data. It leverages tools such as MetFrag, MSFinder, CFM-ID, and SIRIUS to streamline data analysis and extract chemical structure information.

## Features
・Mass spectrometry data processing: Supports multiple annotation tools to perform structure predictions based on MSP format data.
・Spectrum filtering and integration: Consolidates structure information from various tools and identifies Maximum Common Substructures (MCS).
・Data format conversion: Converts MSP data to MS format and prepares inputs for each tool.
